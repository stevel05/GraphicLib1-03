#JGraphicsLib

###This Library wraps the 2Dgraphic elements of JavaFX2 which are:

Shape, Arc, Circle, CubicCurve, Ellipse, Line, Path, Polygon, Polyline, QuadCurve, Rectangle, SVGPath, and Text. As well as LinearGradient and RadialGradient.

You can add these in code, or use the SetObject Method to work with Nodes added using Scene Builder.

**Depends on:** JavaObject.

I created this as I wanted to use rectangle, and got a bit carried away. So I thought I'd share it.

For that reason I haven't tested everything thoroughly, please let me know if there are any issues.

For comprehensive documentation, refer to the Javafx documentation.
